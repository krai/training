Results of finetuning with openimages on coco-trained model. 
Epoch 0: Achieved 0.16 accuracy. 
Epoch 1: Failed at eval accuracy steps.
Epoch 2: Reusmed from Epoch 1. Accuracy achieved is worst than that of Epoch 0, loss is increasing.
Epoch 3: Training failed mid-way becuase of nan values in loss.
